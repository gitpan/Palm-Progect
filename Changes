Revision history for Perl extension Palm::Progect.

[1.0.2] 2001/09/29
    - progconv couldn't handle paths with dots in them (thanks to Kris Gale
      for the bugreport and patch)
    - don't ignore lines that start with # when they are within
      a multi-line field (i.e. a note)

[1.0.1] 2001/07/24
    - Notes were not being imported/exported properly (thanks to
      Alain Mellan for the bugreport and patch)
    - Fixed string packing/unpacking for 5.005 and 5.6.1

[0.9.3] 2001/07/22
    - removed vestiges of Andrew Arensburger's code from Palm::Progect
      (I had originally used Palm::Mail as a template for Palm::Progect)
    - added dual GPL/Artistic license
    - renamed Rebuild_Relationships to Repair_Tree (since it's similar
      to the function of that name in Progect itself)

[0.9.2] 2001/07/21

      They were buggy anyways, so removed mention of them from the docs.
