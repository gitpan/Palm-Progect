
This is Palm::Progect, a module for reading and manipulating
Palm Progect databases.

Progect is a hierarchical todo list/organizer/project manager,
and is available at

    http://progect.sourceforge.net/.

Progect itself is free software, released under the GPL.

The Palm::Progect bundle includes a command line utility called
progconv, which converts back and forth between the Progect PDB format
and a simple text representation:


    [x] Level 1 Todo item
        [10%] Child (progress)
            . Child of Child (informational)

    [80%] (31/12/2001) Progress item
        [ ] Unticked action item

This format is similar to the format that Progect's own built-in
exporter uses.  However, progconv supports almost all of Progect's
fields, including dates, categories, ToDo links and notes. See the
included docs for notes.

The progconv program also converts to and from CSV (Comma Separated
Values) files, which is a format most useful for exchanging data with
spreadsheets and databases.

Prerequisites
-------------

1) p5-Palm (Palm::PDB)

   Andrew Arensburger's great suite of modules for manipulating
   palm database files.

2) Text::CSV_XS

   Only if you intend to import from or export to the CSV format.


Installing
----------

On Unix systems install Palm::Progect as you would any other
perl module:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To read the docs, type:

    perldoc Palm::Progect
or:
    perldoc progconv


On systems without make (e.g. Windows), first copy Progect.pm
into your local library directory (e.g. C:\PERL\lib\site\Palm)
and then place progconv somewhere in your PATH, so you can
run it via:

    perl -S progconv ...

To read the docs, run them through the pod2html program:

    perl -S pod2html.pl Progect.pm > Progect.html
    perl -S pod2html.pl progconv > progconv.html

And then open the html files in your web browser.
