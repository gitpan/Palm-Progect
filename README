This is Palm::Progect, a module for reading and manipulating
Palm Progect databases.

Progect is a hierarchical todo list/organizer/project manager,
and is available at

    http://progect.sourceforge.net/.

Progect itself is free software, released under the GPL.

The Palm::Progect bundle includes a command line utility called
progconv, which converts back and forth between the Progect PDB format
and a simple text representation:

    [x] Level 1 Todo item
        [10%] Child (progress)
            . Child of Child (informational)

    [80%] (31/12/2001) Progress item
        [ ] Unticked action item

This format is similar to the format that Progect's own built-in
exporter uses.  However, progconv supports almost all of Progect's
fields, including dates, priorities, categories, ToDo links and
notes. See the included docs for notes.

The progconv program also converts to and from CSV (Comma Separated
Values) files, which is a format most useful for exchanging data with
spreadsheets and databases.

Users can write their own converters for new formats, and these
converters will integrate into the progconv program.

Version 2.0 of Palm::Progect is a complete rewrite with some new
features.  See upgrade_2.0.txt for details.

Installing
----------
First, install the prerequisite Perl Modules (see "Prerequisites",
below). Next install the Palm::Progect module itself.

If you don't know how to install Perl modules, see "How to Install Perl
Modules" below.

Prerequisites
-------------
All of the following required modules are available on CPAN
(http://search.cpan.org/).  If you don't know how to install
Perl modules, see "How to Install Perl Modules" below.

1) p5-Palm (Palm::PDB)

   Andrew Arensburger's great suite of modules for manipulating
   palm database files.

3) CLASS
4) Class::Accessor
5) Class::Constructor

   These three modules provide some of the necessary object-oriented
   'glue' that holds the Palm::Progect::* modules together.  The first
   two are by Michael G. Schwern, the last is by me.

   On earlier versions of Perl (e.g. version 5.005), special care will be
   required to install Class::Accessor.  See below under "Installing on
   Earlier Versions of Perl"

6) Text::CSV_XS

   This is only required if you intend to import from or export to
   the CSV format.


How to Install Perl Modules (on Unix/Linux/etc)
-----------------------------------------------
You can use the 'cpan' command-line utility to install the modules (easy
to use, but can be tricky to set up).

Or you can install the modules manually by doing the following:

    1) download the module distribution

    2) unpack it into its own folder, e.g.

         $ tar zxvf Palm-Progect-2.0.0.tar.gz

    3) configure and install it:

         $ cd Palm-Progect-2.0.0
         $ perl Makefile.PL
         $ make
         $ make test
         # make install

For that final step ('make install'), you will have to be root.

How to Install Perl Modules (on Windows)
----------------------------------------

   1) download the module distribution

   2) unpack it into its own folder, using a program
      like Windows Commander (http://www.wincmd.com/)
      or WinZip (http://www.winzip.com).

   3) copy all the Perl module files (*.pm) in the
      distribution's 'lib' directory into your local Perl
      library directory (e.g. C:\PERL\lib\site).

      For Palm::Progect, you should end up with something like the
      following directory structure:

          C:\PERL\lib\site\Palm\Progect.pm
          C:\PERL\lib\site\Palm\Progect\Record.pm
          C:\PERL\lib\site\Palm\Progect\Converter.pm
          C:\PERL\lib\site\Palm\Progect\DB_18\Record.pm
          ...

      Some module distributions do not have a 'lib' directory,
      or they contain additional modules outside of the 'lib'
      directory.  They should be installed as follows:

      Distribution         File                Destination
      ------------         ----                -----------
      Class::Constructor   Constructor.pm      site\Class\Constructor.pm

      p5-Palm              Palm\Address.pm     site\Palm\Address.pm
                           Palm\Datebook.pm    site\Palm\Datebook.pm
                           Palm\Mail.pm        site\Palm\Mail.pm
                           Palm\Memo.pm        site\Palm\Memo.pm
                           Palm\PDB.pm         site\Palm\PDB.pm
                           Palm\Raw.pm         site\Palm\Raw.pm
                           Palm\StdAppInfo.pm  site\Palm\StdAppInfo.pm
                           Palm\ToDo.pm        site\Palm\ToDo.pm

      (where 'site' is your local Perl library directory (e.g.
      C:\PERL\lib\site))

   4) Finally, place any executable perl scripts in the distributions
      into a directory in your path (e.g. C:\PERL\bin) so that they can
      be run with perl's -S switch, e.g.:

          perl -S progconv --help

      Distribution         File                Destination
      ------------         ----                -----------
      Palm::Progect        bin\progconv        bin\progconv

      p5-Palm              util\copydb         bin\copydb
                           util\pdbdump        bin\pdbdump

      (where 'bin' is your local Perl binary directory (e.g.
      C:\PERL\bin), and assuming this directory is in your path)


Installing on Earlier Versions of Perl
--------------------------------------

If you are installing on Windows by manually copying files, you
can skip this section.

On earlier versions of Perl (e.g. version 5.005), you should install
Class::Accessor without using the cpan shell, by downloading it
and running the standard:

    $ cd Class-Accessor-0.1.7
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    # make install

During the install, you may read complaints that the 'base' module
not being up to date.  Also, Class::Accessor will fail some of its tests.

These errors and warnings do not appear to be anything to worry about.
Palm::Progect still seems to work fine and pass all of its own tests.


Documentation
-------------

Help for the progconv utility is available with:

    progconv --help

This will include help on any installed Converter modules.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Palm::Progect, you
should have a look at upgrade_2.0.txt to see what has changed.

There is detailed documentation included in this package.
Much of it is in 'pod' format (shorthand for Perl's 'Plain old
Documentation' format).

You can convert all of the included pod docs to html in one step by
using the included 'makedocs' script.  This will create a subdirectory
called 'docs' and put all of the html files there.

On Unix run:

    $ ./makedocs.sh

On Windows run:

    makedocs.bat

The following is a summary of the documentation included in this package:

You can read individual pod documentation with the perldoc command:

    perldoc progconv
    perldoc Palm/Progect.pm

You can convert the Pod to HTML using the pod2html
command:

    pod2html Palm/Progect/Converter/Text.pm > Text.html

If that command doesn't work, try:

    perl -S pod2html.pl Palm/Progect/Converter/Text.pm > Text.html
